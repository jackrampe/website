Changes made: (im sorry this is later than expected, any credit would be greatly appreciated but not expected, thank you.)
1. The first change I made was from your reccomendations, which was to change the background color. I used vanta.js for my new interactive cloud background, which i think looks really nice. 
2. One of the other suggestions you made was to add more information. I really like personal websites that encapsulate all of oneself, so I wanted to add some reccomendations for songs and albums, 
since music is one of my favorite things in the world. I used your suggestion to make the lists more distinct here, aswell, as i made the albums and songs have different color borders, so its clear which 
is which and groups them. 
3. The third change was that my listes wered as distinct between each other as they could have been, so I added a border around them. 
4. The fourth suggestion was adding some navigable menu options on the header, which I implemented through a button to take you to my reccomendations page, which itself has a button to return. This is
my first event listener. 
5. My fifth change was changing the size of the picture. 
6. My second event listener was a customized greeting, so it reads a different greeting depending on the time of day.
